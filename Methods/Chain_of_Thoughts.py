    sample_answer = """The claim that the video shows Greta Thunberg firing a rifle is false. The video in question was uploaded to YouTube with the title "Greta Thunberg fires rifle," leading some users to believe that it shows the climate change activist. However, an investigation using a reverse image search revealed that the person in the video is actually Emmy Slinge, a 31-year-old markswoman from Stockholm.

    Emmy Slinge had posted a video of herself shooting a rifle on December 7th, which led to her being mistaken for Greta Thunberg. The video of Slinge was then mislabeled as showing Thunberg in the YouTube video.

    It is important to note that Thunberg has been a target of online misinformation and conspiracy theories, with false information and doctored images of her circulating on social media. This false claim about the video showing Thunberg firing a rifle adds to the ongoing misinformation targeted at her.

    Therefore, based on the evidence provided, it can be concluded that the claim is false."""
